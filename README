Implementation of `Life` game in Python.
The main purpose is to have a working 3D version of the Life game.

This project is to
1) improve python programming skills,
2) learn the good way of building a simple GUI app in Python
3) see if python is good for prototyping an app(maybe try rewriting in c++ later to see if it's simpler when having a python prototype)
4) see if I could learn how to make an easily extensible life game implementation, so that adding a third dimension to the game would be easy
